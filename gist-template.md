# Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions, or RegEx, are helpful tools used across many programming languages to find a specified combination of characters.  A RegEx allows the programmer to search for any variation of a string matching a pattern instead of being limited to a specific, or "literal", query.  For example, in a large database with multiple email address entries, a RegEx pattern search of `[any name]@[any domain].[any extension]` will easily find all email addresses.

In addition to being powerful search tools, regular expressions can be applied to validate formatting (e.g. passwords and email address), perform quick replacements, and assist with string splitting.
